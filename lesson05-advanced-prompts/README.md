# GenAI Practice (Ollama)

This repository contains my hands-on practice projects while learning Generative AI.
I focus on building **local, cost-free** GenAI applications using **Ollama**.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Ollama (local LLMs)
- Flask (for simple APIs)
- Prompt engineering + structured outputs (JSON)
- RAG & search (later lessons)

## Lessons / Projects
- **Lesson 05 – Advanced Prompt Engineering**
  - Prompt-based code review with a local model
  - Robust parsing (JSON-first, code-block fallback)
  - Output saved as an improved Flask app

## How to run
Each lesson folder has its own README with instructions.

General setup:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
