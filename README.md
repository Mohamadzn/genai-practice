# Generative AI Practice – Microsoft GenAI for Beginners

This repository contains my **hands-on exercises and implementations**
based on the **Microsoft “Generative AI for Beginners” course**.

The goal of this repository is to **learn Generative AI by building**, not just reading theory.
All exercises are implemented with a strong focus on **practical understanding**, **prompt engineering**, and **local experimentation**.

## Course Overview

**Generative AI for Beginners** is a structured learning course that covers:

- Fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Responsible AI concepts
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Function calling and tool usage
- Building and securing AI-powered applications

This repository contains my **personal implementations of the course assignments and exercises**.

## Key Design Choice: Local LLMs (Ollama)

Instead of relying on paid cloud APIs, I intentionally implemented most exercises using:

- **Ollama**
- Lightweight local models such as:
  - `phi3`
  - `phi3:mini`
  - other small open-source LLMs when appropriate

This approach allows:
- Cost-free experimentation
- Better understanding of model limitations
- Focus on prompt design and pipelines rather than model size

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a **lesson or concept** from the course and contains runnable code and documentation.
